WHAT

gserial is a library for serial port communications. You could use it to talk
to Arduinos and other things.

gserial is written in C using the GLib Object System (GObject). It is
introspectable, meaning that bindings are auto-magically generated for a
number of different programming languages including Javascript (gjs), Vala,
Python, Java, Perl, Scheme, Lua . . . and so on.

gserial is also cross-platform. It has been built under Arch Linux (64bit),
Windows 10 (64bit, using MSYS2) and Windows 8 (32bit, also MSYS2).

WHY

gserial exists so that Vala programs could have a simple but comprehensive
cross-platform library for using serial ports.

libserialport is an alternative. It's more comprehensive and mature, but it
does not use GObjects.

HOW - Compile & Install

./autogen.sh --enable-vala
make
make install


BUILDING VAPI FILE

cd src
vapigen --library gserial-1.0 gserial-1.0.gir

Copy the generated gserial-1.0.vapi file into /usr/share/vala/vapi

If you get any errors, please report them on Github.
